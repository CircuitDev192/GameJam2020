JUST HOLD ON is a short, first person zombie apocalypse survival shooter. 
The city in which the game takes place is the epicenter of a global virus outbreak. There are few survivors left.

They are coming to help you. Just hold on.

The controls are typical FPS controls:

WASD - Move

Left Ctrl - Crouch

Left Shift - Sprint

X - Semi/Full Auto

Mouse - Aim

LMB - Shoot
